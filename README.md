Subscription Management System – Backend Crash Course Project

This project is a production-ready backend system for managing subscriptions — complete with real users, real payments, and real-world business logic. Built as part of a backend crash course, the goal was to simulate building a SaaS-like subscription tracker from the ground up, just like in a real company.
